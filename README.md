# crypto_theme_analyzer
Dynamic Cryptocurrency Theme Discovery and Visualization Tool


## Description:
This Python project introduces a sophisticated tool designed to analyze and visualize cryptocurrency market trends over time. Leveraging data from Yahoo Finance, it processes price movements of top cryptocurrencies, identifies distinct themes based on price behavior, and visualizes these trends with semi-transparent, color-coded windows. The tool incorporates advanced data science techniques including z-normalization, linear regression for trend analysis, and Euclidean distance for theme similarity assessment. This project demonstrates my capability to handle complex data processing and visualization tasks, making it a versatile asset for investors and analysts looking to gain deeper insights into cryptocurrency market dynamics.

## Requirements:
Python 3.x
Libraries: yfinance, pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib
Internet access for downloading cryptocurrency data

## Output:
The tool outputs graphical visualizations for each selected cryptocurrency, showcasing the price data overlaid with semi-transparent windows. Each window is color-coded based on its identified theme, illustrating the diversity and evolution of price movements within the specified time frame. The visualizations provide a clear, intuitive representation of market trends, aiding in the analysis and decision-making process for cryptocurrency investments.
